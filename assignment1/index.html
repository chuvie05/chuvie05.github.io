    <h3>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
    <p>The first thing that caught my attention is the visuals of the website. It is very simple and spacious, instead of having lots of text. It mostly use illustrations and straightforward language. Animation and font choice are also very interesting. Just by looking through I could say the owner has a very unique style, which is very good for a portfolio of a creative job.</p>
    <h3>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hovering to play with the cursor (the fly)</li>
        <li>Hovering to see animated elements</li>
        <li>Scrolling to navigate through pages</li>
        <li>Scrolling to see element in a page</li>
        <li>Clicking interactive elements (menu, links, pages)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>3.  What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
    <p> Although the website has a lot of interesting features to explore, there are two things that I spend the most time engaging with:
    <ul>
      <li>Playing around with the cursor: even though it could a very boring thing to notice, I always like website that has their own customized cursor</li>
      <li>Scrolling feature inside a specific frame (like in the following website, we can scroll inside a phone/computer frame)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
    <p>This website is in the form of a portfolio so the goal is showing users (clients) the owner’s previous works, achievements and the developer’s unique style, in order to convince clients why they should hire him/her. The website also attached links of social platforms to help the clients keeping contact with the artist.</p>
    <h3>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
    <p>To achieved the primary goal, the website:
      <ul>
        <li>Has unique visual style for every page</li>
        <li>Providing links of platforms to contact the owner’s website</li>
        <li>Providing clear achievements </li>
        <li>Showcasing previous and current projects</li>
        <li>Demonstrating all the skills with strong references (previous or current projects and artworks)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
    <p>According to the contents and interactions, the website is designed for short-term purposes, mostly for clients who are searching for potential designer/developer for their brand/product. It could also serve educational or researched purposes like inspiration or reference  (from the owner’s projects)</p>
    <h3>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
    <p>Since this is a portfolio website meant to keep the projects up to date, the interactive experience on the website encourages people to periodically visit it from time to time.</p>
    <h3>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
      <li>Customized cursor: </li>
      <li>Layout: I did some research and found a website that has similar layout - Resn. Both website looks spacious by having decent negative space with the eye-catching placement of the graphic.</li>
      <li>External link and showcasing: Behance is the first thing popped in my mind when I thought about portfolio website. Behance also allow users to showcase their projects and provide contacts’ link, and shares the same goal as any other portfolio website, which is helping designers to gain clients.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
    <p>Website like Behance showcasing designs attached with designer contact information, encouraging designing enthusiastist and clients to explore and interact design details with a professional mindset. The overall experience promotes deep engagement, curiosity, and professional networking - all behaviors commonly associated with browsing a portfolio website like Behance</p>
    <h3>11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
    <p>When engaging with the Alannn website, which draw the inspiration from portfolio website like Behance, the projects and media references intended to make visitors feel a range of emotion, from inspired, admirable, respect to curious.</p>
    <h3>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
    <p>This is very personal, for me, the part that I feel frustrating is typography. The choosen font is script font type but the designer choose to write all the text in capital, I find it somehow hard to read vividly although there are not many things happen on the screen and the typography is one of the highlight factors other than graphics.</p>
    <h3>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
    <p>One of the most satisfying part for me might be animation, the owner has decent animated movements that I find very satisfied to watch, they’re not just smooth but also very creative, some of them also remind me of games from old websites.</p>
